<!--

You can download all the icons used for the buttons from here: https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJulianPrieber%2Flittlelink-custom%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Flittlelink%2Ficons.

For custom icons to apply you have to enable them in the config first.

Include your edited icons in the "custom-icons" folder while keeping the original file names.

You can use other file types like PNG, JPG, etc. by defining a custom file extension in the config.
